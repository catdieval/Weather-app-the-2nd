# Weather-app

This web application is a fork of the [Weather-app](https://github.com/catdieval/Weather-app) project developed as a team by me and [Mareike Flachsenberg](https://github.com/MareikeFla) during our [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/en) web development course. It is written in React.js.

The current project is a further development of the fork on my own.

This web application displays the status of the weather (☀️ good or 🌧️ bad) and the temperature 🌡️ in Europe, every minute.

A list of suitable activities depending on the weather are also shown.

The user can use a form to create a new activity, where they enter the name of the activity and if it is suitable for good weather. The activity is then displayed in the list, depending on if the activity is suitable for good weather. 

Added activities have a delete button ❌ . Clicking on this button removes the corresponding activity from the list.
